import whatever from littlebook
import protocol from littlebook
extend protocol handlers with ts
add protocol handlers
protocol handlers take a url and return a LittlebookResponse
LittlebookResponse extends Response. automerge: adds .docHandle() example
.text() secretly uses same text object behind the scenes maybe for files?
though the text editor thing will be operating on a _response_ now (not codemirror, that's still a string)
draw this idea out!
how does new file work? haha
i guess id have to choose a type up front because it might not be text
new TEXT file is different. lol could use about:blank as the url
worker transforms import to lb.import, which goes through the worker
worker transforms urls to whatever is in lb.importmap
lb.import uses lb.fetch, checks protocol handler, etc
the bootstrap needs to set up a stdlib location, a config file location, and a protocol handler for whatever protocol those use
